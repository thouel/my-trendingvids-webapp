BUGs

- componentize ShowCard (300+ lines)
- from ../p-shows, why clicking outside of the Modal redirects to ../movies (and vice versa) ?

Handle form errors => https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/error
Add a toaster system to display info, error messages
Rework as PrismaAdapter utils/db/shows and utils/db/users
The display of pinned shows should be completed by classic display
When removing a pinned show, it should refresh the ShowsCarousel behind : add a state in ShowsCarousel and give the setXXX to the modal so that it is rerendered when a change occurs in modal => Problem: ShowCard is not directly embedded in ShowsCarousel (<Link/>)
Make the caroussel infinite
Add a video in the Show Card
